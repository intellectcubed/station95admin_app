### Manual Time Selection


- Two dropdown elements are displayed:
- **Start Time** dropdown containing values from `0000` to `2300` in hourly increments.
- **End Time** dropdown containing values from `0000` to `2300` in hourly increments.
- The user may manually select both start and end times.
- If either start or end time is selected manually, it is expected that the other will be selected as well before executing the command.


### Quick Select Time Ranges


- A separate control (dropdown or list) labeled **Quick Select** presents predefined time ranges.
- Selecting a quick range automatically fills both start and end time fields.


#### Predefined Ranges
```
1800–0600
0600–1800
1800–0000
0000–0600
0600–1200
1200–1800
```


### Selection Logic


- If the user selects a **Quick Select** range, that value overrides any previous manual selections.
- If the user starts with manual dropdowns, the system expects both start and end times to be explicitly chosen.
- Once a Quick Select option is chosen, both start and end times are auto-populated and locked until cleared or changed.


### Validation Rules


1. If no time values are selected (either via dropdowns or Quick Select), the command cannot be applied.
2. When manual entry is used, both start and end times must be present.
3. When Quick Select is used, both start and end times are derived from the selection.
4. Switching between methods should update or clear the other inputs accordingly.


### Example UI Behavior (Pseudocode)


```javascript
function onQuickSelectChange(range) {
const [start, end] = range.split("–");
document.getElementById("startTime").value = start;
document.getElementById("endTime").value = end;
}


function onManualChange() {
document.getElementById("quickSelect").value = ""; // clear quick select
}
```
